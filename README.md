# Age Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks  

## Overview

This repository focuses on an AI project for **age detection from facial images** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation of models like **VGGNet**, **DenseNet**, and **EfficientNet** on diverse datasets (**Adience** and **UTKFace**). The repository handles tasks such as cleaning noisy images, applying augmentations, and training models to classify images into predefined age groups. Reports provide a detailed comparative analysis of model performances, metrics, and visualizations.
