# Age Detection using CNN Project

This project leverages EfficientNet,Densenet,Vggnet and PyTorch for image-related tasks. The instructions below will guide you on how to set up, run, and analyze the project on Kaggle Notebooks.

## Prerequisites

- A Kaggle account
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning frameworks like PyTorch
- Familiarity with Kaggle Notebooks

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Download the Code

- Upload the provided `.ipynb` notebook file (`efficient-net.ipynb`) to your Kaggle Notebook environment.

### 2. Set Up Dependencies

Kaggle Notebooks already come pre-installed with most of the required libraries. However, to ensure compatibility, run the following command in a code cell to install missing dependencies given in the requirement.txt file

### 3. Import Sample Data

#### Upload Data

1. Prepare your dataset (e.g., a `.zip` file containing the sample data). 
2. In the Kaggle Notebook interface, click on `+ Add Data` in the right-hand menu.
3. Upload the `.zip` file containing your dataset.

#### Unzip Data

Add the following code to a cell to extract the dataset into the notebook’s environment:

```python
import zipfile
import os

data_zip = '/kaggle/input/<your-data-file>.zip'  # Replace with the actual filename
output_dir = '/kaggle/working/dataset'  # Directory to extract the dataset

with zipfile.ZipFile(data_zip, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(output_dir)

print("Data extracted to:", output_dir)
```

### 4. Verify the Dataset

Run the following command to list the contents of the dataset directory and ensure the files are properly extracted:

```python
import os
print(os.listdir('/kaggle/working/dataset'))
```

### 5. Execute the Notebook

1. Step through each cell in the notebook.
2. Ensure outputs are generated correctly.
3. Modify any paths if necessary to match the dataset location.

### 6. Analyze Results

Inspect the output visualizations and metrics generated by the notebook to evaluate the model's performance.

## Notes

- The notebook is designed for ease of use on Kaggle. No additional environment setup is required beyond installing missing dependencies.
- If the notebook contains any dataset-specific paths, ensure they align with the directory where you extracted your dataset.

## Troubleshooting

- **Library Not Found:** Use `!pip install <library>` to install missing libraries.
- **Path Issues:** Double-check paths for the uploaded dataset and ensure they match those in the notebook.
- **Out of Memory:** Use smaller batch sizes or switch to a Kaggle GPU runtime (enable this in the Notebook Settings).

By following these steps, you’ll successfully execute the project and analyze its results on Kaggle. Enjoy exploring EfficientNet and PyTorch in this exciting project!
